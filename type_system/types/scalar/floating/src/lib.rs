//! # Floating-Point Type

//! Length      Signed
//! 32-bit      f32
//! 64-bit      f64
//! ```
//! The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs itâ€™s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is
//! capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed. The `f32` type is a
//! single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.
