mod manage_crates {
    //! A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time.
    //!
    //! A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.
    //!
    //! Binary crates are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run, each binary
    //! crate must have a function called main.
    //!
    //! Library crates don’t have a main function, and they don’t compile to an executable. Instead,
    //! they define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects.
    //!
    //! The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root
    //! module of your crate.
